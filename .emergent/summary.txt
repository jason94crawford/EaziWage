**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Applications:** A unified web platform containing:
    *   Public-facing website
    *   Employer Application
    *   Employee Application
    *   Admin Application
2.  **Access Control:** Role-based access for Employees, Employers, and Admins.
3.  **Authentication:** JWT-based custom authentication.
4.  **Core Functionality:**
    *   **Employee:** Registration, KYC document submission, view earned wages, request advances, view transaction history.
    *   **Employer:** Company onboarding, employee management, payroll integration (conceptual), and a dashboard.
    *   **Admin:** Verification of employers/employees, review of risk scores, and management of disbursements.

6.  **Integrations:** Mock integrations for mobile money providers (M-PESA, MTN, Airtel).
7.  **File Storage:** Use local file storage for KYC documents.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. The marketing website is highly polished, with multiple content pages (About, Partners, Blog), a consistent green/dark theme, and a professional map component. All legal policy pages have been populated with content from user-provided documents and redesigned with a sidebar layout to match the Terms of Service page. The main Employee Dashboard has been completely redesigned with a modern, dark aesthetic, and a test employee user has been created for verification purposes.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was starting a new user request to redesign the Request Advance page and create other key employee-facing screens (Transaction History, Settings/Profile) to match the new, modern aesthetic of the Employee Dashboard. The agent had begun by analyzing the reference design screenshots provided by the user in a previous message.
*   **Status:** NOT STARTED
*   **Agent Testing Done:** N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** After implementation, use the screenshot tool to visually verify the new pages by logging in with the employee credentials. Then, use the frontend testing agent to conduct a full regression test on the employee portal, ensuring all new components and interactive elements (like the advance request slider) function correctly.
*   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending issues or bugs. All work is feature-driven based on user requests.

**In progress Task List**:
*   **Task 1:** Redesign and Implement Core Employee Pages (P0 - HIGHEST)
    *   **Where to resume:** The agent needs to start the implementation of the new employee-facing pages. The reference designs are the screenshots extracted from the  artifact. The steps are:
        1.  Create/Update the  component to include the slider-based UI.
        2.  Create/Update the  component, including filtering capabilities.
        3.  Create/Update the  and  components.
        4.  Ensure all new pages are integrated into the employee-side routing and navigation.
    *   **What will be achieved with this?** The core functionality of the employee portal will be built out with a modern, consistent UI, as specified by the user's designs.
    *   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    *   **Blocked on something:** No
