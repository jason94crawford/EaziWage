**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic, File Handling ()
*   **Frontend:** React, , State Management (useState, useEffect), TailwindCSS
*   **Database:** MongoDB
*   **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT), Emergent-managed Google OAuth
*   **API Client:** Axios

**key DB schema**
*   **users:** 
*   **employers:** (To be created) 

**changes in tech stack**
*   None.

**All files of reference**
*   **/app/frontend/src/pages/employee/Settings.jsx**: Needs UI fixes for the logout button and icon gradients, and backend integration for password changes.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/employee/EmployeePageLayout.jsx**: The notification panel logic/styling needs to be debugged for mobile here.
*   **/app/frontend/src/pages/marketing/LandingPage.jsx**: The primary design reference for colors and gradients.
*   **/app/backend/server.py**: Needs new models and endpoints for the Employer Onboarding flow.
*   **/app/frontend/src/pages/employee/OnboardingPage.jsx**: Can be used as a template for the new multi-step Employer Onboarding UI.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   The notifications display logic in  or  needs to be refactored to be mobile-responsive.

**key api endpoints**
*   
*   
*    (to be created)
*    (to be created)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   **Your highest priorities (P0) are the small UI fixes reported in the last user message.** Address the logout button color, icon gradients, and mobile notification panel immediately. This will help build user trust.
*   **Your next major task is to build the Employer Onboarding portal.** This is a large, multi-step feature. The user has provided extremely detailed requirements for the data to be collected.
*   **Follow the existing design patterns.** The user wants the Employer portal to have the same look, feel, requirements as the Employee interface. Use the recently redesigned employee pages as your direct reference.
*   **Plan the employer portal carefully.** Start by defining the new MongoDB schema and FastAPI endpoints in  before building the frontend. This will be a complex, multi-part form.
*   **Be mindful of the recurring UI feedback loop.** The user has a very specific aesthetic in mind. Proactively reference  for all design choices to minimize rework.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User (LATEST):** Provided a detailed list of UI fixes (red logout button, icon gradients, mobile notifications) and a comprehensive set of requirements for a new multi-step Employer Onboarding portal, including all required documents and a list of business sectors. **STATUS: NOT STARTED.**
2.  **Agent:** Finished implementing the biometric scan feature and updated the PRD.
3.  **User:** Clicked to test the biometric scan. **STATUS: ADDRESSED.**
4.  **Agent:** Implemented the in-app, scrollable view for Terms & Privacy.
5.  **User:** Clicked to test the Terms & Privacy section. **STATUS: ADDRESSED.**

**Project Health Check:**
*   **Broken:** The notifications panel is not responsive and does not work on mobile.
*   **Mocked:** Mobile money API integrations, Apple Login, and all employer-side payroll functionality. The Biometric Scan is a UI mock and does not perform a real scan.
*   **User Dissatisfaction:** Moderate. The user is pleased with the recent feature additions but has a precise eye for UI details that are not yet perfect. The main source of potential dissatisfaction will be the time and accuracy required for the large employer portal build.

**3rd Party Integrations**
*   
*   
*   
*    (for Emergent-managed Google OAuth)

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES. The agent successfully used it to validate the complete employee dashboard redesign. It will be critical for testing the upcoming employer portal.
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
- **Test files created:** None
- **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
*   **Admin Email:**
