**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   The user is highly focused on the UI/UX. This is the top priority.
*   Your current task is to **complete the redesign of the marketing website pages only**. Do not work on the dashboards (Admin, Employer, Employee) for now, as the user explicitly said to ignore them.
*   The new design must be rich, modern, and align with an African-fintech aesthetic. It should not be minimalistic.
*   The green theme must be maintained.
*   A dark/light theme toggle has been added and must be functional across all new pages.
*   After implementing the pages, use the screenshot tool extensively to verify the visual appearance in both themes before showing it to the user.
